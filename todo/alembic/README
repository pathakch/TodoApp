Generic single-database configuration.

Steps to use alembic for upgrade and downgrade. 
step.1. pip install alembic
step.2. create alembic environment command - <alembic init alembic> it will create one folder named alembic, and one alembic ini file
step.3. configure db url in alembic.ini file - copy sqlalchemy nurl from database.py file and paste it in alembic.ini file at sqlalchemy.url
step.3. then start creating alembic revision 1. upgrade, 2.downgrade
step.4. import models.py file in .env file of alembic folder.
step.5. make required 2 changes in .env file 
        1.remove if statement before this line 'fileConfig(config.config_file_name)'
        2.change target_metadat from None to 'models.Base.metadata'
step.6. create revision by running this command <alembic revision -m"create phone number for user column"> in terminal
        This command will create one file with a new revision number in version directory of alembic folder.
        Then change the upgrade code in this file 
step.7. run the upgrade command <alembic upgrade {revision_id} > 

After all above steps check your application it won't have phone_number column in users table, 
Next step - change model.py add phone_number column in user table and again run application and check in swagger it will have one new 
column in user table as phone_number
And this way we cna upgrade our db using alembic 

Same steps will repeat for downgrade - we need to change code in the file for downgrade and then run command to downgrade 
command to downgrade : <alembic downgrade -1>
