Steps to use pytest
step.1. To use pytest we need to create one folder named 'test' inside project directory
step.2. Inside test folder we need to create one file with name starting with 'test_'
Step.3. Inside file created in step.2 we create functions with name starting with 'test_'
when we write 'pytest' in terminal then pytest will automatically search files with name starting with 'test_' and then functions inside it starting with 'test_' and run it
